# Simon game
 The Simon game is a classic electronic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of lights and sounds that the game produces. Each round, the game adds a new random element to the sequence, increasing in complexity as the game progresses. Players must carefully observe and remember the sequence to continue advancing through the levels. The objective is to see how many levels the player can successfully complete without making a mistake. The Simon game challenges players' memory and concentration skills in a fun and engaging way, making it a timeless favorite for all ages.
